# R-WASH-wet-deposition-device
Rain Water Automatic Sampler Hardware (R-WASH), a cost-effective semi-automatic device designed for high-resolution wet deposition sampling, enabling the collection of hourly rainwater samples. The R-WASH system consists of three modules: rainwater collection, distribution and a storage module designed to hold up to 24 samples. 

The first module consists of rainwater collection through a set of three stainless steel funnels, each with an area of 0.20 m², 1.3 meters above the ground. The number of funnels can be adjusted according to rainfall intensity; additional funnels can be used during a drizzle to increase the collection area, whereas fewer funnels can be employed during a rainstorm to prevent overflow.  The funnels are connected to the movable disk of the distribution module via 6mm PFA hoses using pneumatic quick-connect fittings of NPT 1/8” type with a 6mm internal diameter. Each funnel features a 30 mm hole at its centre, equipped with a stainless-steel drainage valve and a flow reducer that narrows the diameter from 30 mm to 6 mm .

The distribution module comprises two overlapping disks affixed to the equipment box lid. The under-fixed disk is made of PTFE with a radius of 85 mm and a thickness of 20 mm.  It features 24 wedge-shaped holes, each 5 mm in diameter, with threaded lower parts (1/8”),  and a central hole with a diameter of 25 mm. A movable stainless-steel disk was positioned above the fixed disk with a diameter of 170 mm, a thickness of 5 mm, and a central hole of 25 mm. This movable disk includes a threaded hole of 1/8” and is secured to the stepper motor shaft (NEMA 23 IP65) by a stainless-steel flange, enabling its rotation over the fixed disk. The stepper motor used in this project is equipped with dust protection (IP6) and water-jet protection (IP5). 

Pneumatic quick-connect fittings of NPT 1/8 with an internal diameter of 6 mm were attached to each of the threaded holes of the fixed and movable disks. The fitting attached to the movable disk connects to the collection funnels through PFA hoses, while the fittings on the fixed disk are threaded through the internal part of the equipment lid and connected to the collection bottles. At the collection position, the hole in the upper disk aligns with one of the holes in the movable disk, connecting the funnels to the collection bottles.

A system coupled to an Arduino Uno model board with a DS1307 RTC shield activates the stepper motor rotation. A code was developed to rotate the stepper motor by 14.4° (8 steps) at each specified time interval, typically every hour, thereby realigning the hole in the movable disk with the next hole in the fixed disk. The motor’s rotation interval can also be adjusted based on the rainfall volume or specific sampling requirements. The electronic circuit of the device is positioned in a waterproof PVC box with an IP66 protection rating, ensuring protection against dust and water. The power supply output is routed through a side-sealed hole.

The storage module consists of a 400 mm height, 420 mm width, and 320 mm depth box (Figure 8). It was designed to accommodate 24 glass bottles (250 ml). Additionally, the box lid is equipped with holes to facilitate attachment of the box containing the electrical circuit and securing the PTFE disk. PFA tubes connected to the distribution module's holes are linked to the bottle lids for sample collection and storage. Check valves were employed to allow air venting and prevent sample contamination.
